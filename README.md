Solutions for book *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*.
In the futre analysis of exercises may also be committed.

**Still in progress now.**

## Environment
Genuine knowledge comes from practice.

### macOS
I'm running macOS Sierra (10.12.6) at the time learning (May, 2018). 
To install MIT-Scheme, just execute in Terminal `homebrew install mit-scheme` works fine.

## Online Materials

### Home Page
The [official site](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html) provides supplementary materials for self-study. Have a look! 

### E-book
The site has already provided a free html version of text, however, a well type-setting PDF version is my favorite. Check [sarabander/sicp-pdf](https://github.com/sarabander/sicp-pdf).

## Milestones
This repository (at first) is chiefly served as a log of learning progress.
