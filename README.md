## Environment Setup
Genuine knowledge comes from practice.

What we need to do first is to setup environment for development.
That is to install MIT-Scheme by following instructions in [*How to get SCHEME*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/scheme/index.html).

### macOS
I'm running macOS Sierra (10.12.6) at the time learning (May, 2018).
To install MIT-Scheme, `homebrew install mit-scheme` works fine.

### Linux
On a VPS I also installed Linux (Debian 10.9) served as a playground for programming.
```bash
$ apt install mit-scheme
```
It ships with `mit-scheme/stable 10.1.5-1 amd64` at the time being (May, 2021).

## Online Materials
### Web Site
The [official site](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html) provides supplementary materials for self-study. Have a look! 

### E-book
The web site has already provided a free [html version](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) of text, however, a well type-setting [PDF version](https://github.com/sarabander/sicp-pdf) is also an option.

### Open Course
The course [6.001](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/) using this textbook by MIT  is a wonderful start. Follow it!

### Solutions
The community worked out [a collection of solutions](http://community.schemewiki.org/?SICP-Solutions) for the book.
Check that before you move on.
